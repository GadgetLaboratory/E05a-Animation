Hey, Larry here.

So, I've messed around with the code as much as I can... though, that- isn't much.  You know my situation already.  As such, I'll at least mess around with this more in class with proper technology, but thanks to some looking up of stuff and some recalling what we went over in class, I at least have a decent idea of what I'm looking at.  Pending further investigation, I've gotten as much mileage as I can from this, for now.  Went and commented what needed it (though that isn't much) and then left it at that.

Also, when I have the means, I can revisit this and attempt to actually make main3 into something significant.
